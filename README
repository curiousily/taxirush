Taxi Rush is a taxi company simulation
The process that is simulated is simple:
1. The client to a dispatcher for a taxi
	If taxi is available
		the taxi takes the job
	Else
		client calls to the dispatcher after certain amount of time
2. After a taxi completes his job, he calls to the dispatcher to be considered for next job

================ How To Run It ================

On the first node do the following:

erl -name dispatcher@vini.bg -setcookie taxirush
c(taxirush).
taxirush:run_simulation().

On the second (and consecutive) node(s):

edit the hosts file to include the host like this

ADDRESS e.g. 192.168.1.1 vini.bg

erl -name taxi1@taxies.bg -setcookie taxirush
net_adm:ping(dispatcher@vini.bg).
c(taxi).
taxi:start_working().
